    "pipe(\"Great Product , Value for Money, Original product, great quality. Good quality Very very nice Toothpaste Le sakte ho Worth the value I bought it for @281 pack of 4×200g and 2nd time @546 for 8×200gToothpaste is no doubt best but the packaging is ordenary it should be improved and sometime the price gets high otherwise happy with the product 😊😊 This is very good paste. Good 👍 Product quality is very good at good price of 277 1) Effect on teeth: It claims to solve many teeth problems, maybe there is effect but I didnt notice any.2) Sensitivity: Maybe not great for sensitive teeth. But not too bad.3) Taste: Tastes like some ayurvedic recipe. Not bad.4) Ingredients: Has many natural ingredients and minimal chemicals compared to other pastes.5) Price: The 3+1 combos are so much cheaper than the single ones. There are 100g, 150g, 200g variants in 3+1 combos, so check whichever you can afford and whichever is on biggger discount.Overall: Holygrail toothpaste. Would repurchase till I find a better cheaper alternative. Nice Indian product world's very reasonablly with very reasonable rate Good\")"
